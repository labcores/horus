This readme details the collection of data from the presidency candidates for Brazilian elections at TV Bandeirantes in 2018-08-09 (YYYY-MM-DD).

* The code does not filter any kind of word, expression, hashtag or term, it is an unbiased version of commnents during the day of the debate.
* A radius point around the Palacio do Planalto, located on Brasilia, capital of Brazil and the business address of the president, is the main center for expanding the circle around the entire country.
* The following picture depicts the scenario of the radius around Brazil, entering the boundaries of the nearby countries, but the data will only be downloaded in Brazilian Portuguese, preventing a multi-idiom collection.
